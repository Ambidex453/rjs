# rjs: R in JavaScript

Introducing R in JavaScript, a way to insert R code directly into websites, powered by [OpenCPU](https://github.com/opencpu/opencpu).

You can use it in 2 easy steps.

## Step 1
Add `<script src='https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/kdpsingh/rjs/r.js'></script>` anywhere in your HTML file (or download r.js locally).

## Step 2
Add `class = "r-code"` to any HTML element.

That's it.

After `rjs` runs, the `class` will changed to `"r-code-output"`. You can run R code dynamically in JavaScript by setting the class of any HTML element to `"r-code"` and then calling `rjs();`.

# `rjs` can:
- Auto-detect and process both `R` and `Rmd` formats
- Handle special characters in the input
- Render to non-HTML formats such as pdf_document (`rjs` automatically provides a link to the file)
